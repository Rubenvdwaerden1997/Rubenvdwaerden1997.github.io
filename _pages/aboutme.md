# Ruben van der Waerden

Ruben van der Waerden (1997) is a PhD candidate at the CARA Lab as part of the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group. He completed both his Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical Engineering and Master's Degree in Medical Engineering at the Technical University of Eindhoven.

During his master's studies, Ruben developed a keen interest in AI applications within the medical field. His master's thesis focused on deriving blood pressure from non-invasive photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals using deep learning models.

Since March 2023, Ruben has been working as a PhD candidate within the Cardiology department. His research focuses on automated analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images during cardiac catheterization procedures, aiming to develop a new method for assessing the risk of myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease. This research is supervised by Niels van Royen, Ivana Isgum, and Jos Thannhauser.
